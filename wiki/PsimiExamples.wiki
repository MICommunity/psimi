== PSI-MI XML ==

This section contains examples on how to work with PSI-MI XML.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/psimi/source/browse/trunk/psimi-examples/src/main/java/org/hupo/psi/mi/example/xml/CreateXml.java Create PSI-MI XML]: Shows how to create a PSI-MI XML programmatically.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/psimi/source/browse/trunk/psimi-examples/src/main/java/org/hupo/psi/mi/example/xml/CreateXmlWithFeatures.java Create PSI-MI XML with features]: Very similar to the previous example, but this one includes how to create features for the participants.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/psimi/source/browse/trunk/psimi-examples/src/main/java/org/hupo/psi/mi/example/xml/CreateEntryPerPublication.java Group interactions in entries]: if you have a file that contains interactions from multiple experiments in one unique entry, you may want to use code like the one of this example to create one entry per experiment.
