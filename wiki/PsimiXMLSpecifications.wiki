#summary PSI-MI XML 2.5 format specifications

= Introduction =

The PSI-MI XML 2.5 is a community standard for molecular interactions which has been jointly developed by major data providers (BIND, CellZome, DIP, GSK, HPRD, Hybrigenics, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, Serono, U. Bielefeld, U. Bordeaux, U. Cambridge, and others). 

This format is stable and used for several years now : published in October 2007 (Broadening the Horizon â€“ Level 2.5 of the HUPO-PSI Format for Molecular Interactions; Samuel Kerrien et al. BioMed Central. 2007.), it has been adapted for many different usages.

It can be used for storing any kind of molecular interaction data :
 * complexes and binary interactions
 * not only protein-protein interactions, can describe nucleic acids interactions and others
 * complexes modelling by using interactionRef in participants instead of interactor or interactorRef

= XML compact and expanded formats =

Two different flavours of this format have been developed : the *compact* format and the *expanded* format. These two different formats are described in a single XML schema which can be confusing because it is easy to mix the two different flavours. To be able to fully enjoy the flexibility of the PSI-MI XML 2.5 format, it is important to understand what are the two different flavours and what are the limits between them.

== Compact format ==

In the compact format, the description of experiments and interactors is done at the beginning of the *entry* using *experimentList* and *interactorList* elements. When describing the interactions (in the next element *interactionList*), we will use references to the previously described experiments and interactors using their *id* attributes.

== What to do? ==

1) Describe all the experiments of your file in the experimentList at the entry level. All the id attributes of the experiments must be present and unique in the all file (not only with experiments but also must be different from interaction ids, interactor ids, etc.)

2) Describe all the interactors of your file in the interactorList at the entry level. All the id attributes of the interactors must be present and unique in the all file (not only with interactors but also must be different from interaction ids, experiment ids, etc.)

3) For each interaction, use the element *experimentRef* in the experimentList. You should refer to the id attribute of one of the experiments described at the entry level.

4) For each participant, use the element *interactorRef* (or *interactionRef* if you want to describe a complex). You should refer to the id attribute of one of the interactors/interactions described at the entry level. 

5) For each experimental interactor (participant level), use the element *interactorRef*. You should refer to the id attribute of one of the interactors described at the entry level.

6) For each inferred interaction (interaction level), the participantRef (interacting participant) or featureRef (binding site interacting with other binding sites) should refer to a participant or feature described within the interaction and not to a participant or feature described in another interaction.

7) Several elements can use experiment references which should point to one experiment described at the entry level :

 * interaction confidences
 * interaction parameters
 * inferred interaction  
 * participant identification method
 * participant experimental role
 * participant experimental preparation
 * participant experimental interactor
 * participant feature
 * participant host organism 
 * participant confidence
 * participant parameters  

=== Advantages ===

 * when using several time the same experiments and same interactors for different interactions, it allows to reduce redundancy of the experiment descriptions and/or interactor descriptions in the file.
 * As a result, the file is more compact and smaller

=== Drawbacks ===

 * It can be more difficult to edit manually the file. Indeed, there is a lot of interactors and/or experiments in the file, using references to them using their 'id' attributes can be fastidious and take more time.
 * When a user reads the file, it can be annoying to come back to the beginning of the file every time he wants to read the experiment description of an interaction.

=== Warnings ===

 * the *experimentalInteractor* element of a participant must also refer to an interactor described in the interactorList at the entry level using the interactorRef element.
 * it is strongly recommended to avoid describing experiments and/or interactors within the interaction instead of describing it at the level of the entry. It will not be a problem at the parsing time if no experiment references are used for the experiment described within the interaction. The experiment described within the interaction will always be considered as the default experiment for this interaction, independently from the compact or expanded flavour of the file. However, it will be impossible to refer to it later in the file and it can be really messy.

== Expanded format ==

In the expanded format, the description of experiments and interactors is done within each interaction. The file doesn't contain any *experimentList* or *interactorList* at the *entry* level, it only contains an *interactionList*.

=== Advantages ===

 * It is easier to edit and read the file

=== Drawbacks ===

 * Can be very redundant because we may have to repeat the description of the same experiment and interactor several times in different interactions.
 * It is easier to forget some elements in the experiment description and/or interactor description.
 * The file is bigger

=== Warnings ===

In some cases, you may need to refer to experiments because you cannot describe experiments within this element :

 * interaction confidences : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and this interaction has different confidence scores depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.
 * interaction parameters : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and this interaction has different parameters depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.
 * inferred interaction : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and this interaction has different inferred interactions depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.  
 * participant identification method : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different identification methods depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.
 * participant experimental role : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different experimental roles, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment. 
 * participant experimental preparation : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different experimental preparations, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment. 
 * participant experimental interactor : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different experimental interactors, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment. 
 * participant feature : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different features depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment. 
 * participant host organism : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has been expressed in different host organisms depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment. 
 * participant confidence : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different confidence scores depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.
 * participant parameters : if several experiments are attached to a same interaction and one of the participant has different parameters depending on the experiment, you may want to add the experimentRef element pointing to the *id* attribute of one experiment.    

It is possible to use experiment references in the expanded format *only* if we refer to an experiment described within the current interaction. In the expanded format, each interaction is independent from each other and it is not possible to be be within an interaction and use references to other experiments and interactors which have been described in other interactions.
