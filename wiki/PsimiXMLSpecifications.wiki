#summary PSI-MI XML 2.5 format specifications

= Introduction =

The PSI-MI XML 2.5 is a community standard for molecular interactions which has been jointly developed by major data providers (BIND, CellZome, DIP, GSK, HPRD, Hybrigenics, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, Serono, U. Bielefeld, U. Bordeaux, U. Cambridge, and others). 

This format is stable and used for several years now : published in October 2007 (Broadening the Horizon â€“ Level 2.5 of the HUPO-PSI Format for Molecular Interactions; Samuel Kerrien et al. BioMed Central. 2007.), it has been adapted for many different usages.

It can be used for storing any kind of molecular interaction data :
 * complexes and binary interactions
 * not only protein-protein interactions, can describe nucleic acids interactions and others
 * complexes modelling by using interactionRef in participants instead of interactor or interactorRef

= XML compact and expanded formats =

Two different flavours of this format have been developed : the *compact* format and the *expanded* format. These two different formats are described in a single XML schema which can be confusing because it is easy to mix the two different flavours. To be able to fully enjoy the flexibility of the PSI-MI XML 2.5 format, it is important to understand what are the two different flavours and what are the limits between them.

== Compact format ==

In the compact format, the description of experiments and interactors is done at the beginning of the *entry* using *experimentList* and *interactorList* elements. When describing the interactions (in the next element *interactionList*), we will use references to the previously described experiments and interactors using their *id* attributes.

=== Advantages ===

 * when using several time the same experiments and same interactors for different interactions, it allows to reduce redundancy of the experiment descriptions and/or interactor descriptions in the file.
 * As a result, the file is more compact and smaller

=== Drawbacks ===

 * It can be more difficult to edit manually. Indeed, there is a lot of interactors and/or experiments in the file, using references to them using their 'id' attributes can be fastidious and take more time.
 * When a user reads the file, it can be annoying to come back to the beginning of the file every time he wants to read the experiment description of an interaction.

=== Examples ===


== Expanded format ==

In the expanded format, the description of experiments and interactors is done within each interaction. The file doesn't contain any *experimentList* or *interactorList* at the *entry* level, it only contains an *interactionList*.

=== Advantages ===

 * It is easier to edit and read the file

=== Drawbacks ===

 * Can be very redundant because we may have to repeat the description of the same experiment and interactor several times in different interactions.
 * It is easier to forget some elements in the experiment description and/or interactor description.
 * The file is bigger

=== Examples ===
