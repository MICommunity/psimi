#summary JAMI: Java framework for Molecular Interaction

= Introduction =

The aim of JAMI is to provide a single java library and framework which unifies the standard formats such as PSI-MI XML and PSI-MITAB.

The JAMI model interfaces are abstracted from both formats to hide the complexity/requirements of each format. The development of softwares and tools on top of this framewrok simplifies the integration and support of the two standard formats.

It avoids endless conversions to different formats and avoid code/unit test duplicate as the code becomes more modular.

== Interactions ==

In the JAMI data model, we distinguish several types of interactions: 
  * *Interaction Evidences*: experimental description of an interaction in a specific experiment
  * *Modelled interactions*: abstract interactions which can be supported by experimental evidences (interaction evidences). Modelled interactions are abstracted from any experimental details apart from a list of interaction evidences
  * *Complexes*: A more specific modelled interaction which can be considered as a biological entity and then can interact with other molecules

== Binary Interactions ==

Binary interactions are an extension of Interaction and can only be composed of two participants. As for the Interaction, you can have several types of Binary Interactions:
  * *Binary Interaction Evidences*: experimental description of an interaction in a specific experiment
  * *Modelled Binary interactions*: abstract interactions which can be supported by experimental evidences (interaction evidences). Modelled interactions are abstracted
