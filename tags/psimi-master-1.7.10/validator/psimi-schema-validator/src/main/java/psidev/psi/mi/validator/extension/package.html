This package contains a specific extension of the Validator framework for the PSI-MI 2.5 Schema.
<br/>
Default validators classes have been specialized to fit the MI 2.5 needs.
Pachage structure:
<pre>
    <b>model</b>: classes autogenerated by JAXB (these classes should not be edited manually)
    <b>rules</b>: the distinct rules implemented for that specific validator.
    <b>test</b>:  eventual tests implemented for that validator.
             we encourage people to write JUnit test to check the good behaviour of their rule.
    <b>xpath</b>: Helper classes that simplify the manual handling of the Context of an Error.
</pre>
