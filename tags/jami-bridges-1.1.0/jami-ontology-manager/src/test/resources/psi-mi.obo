remark: Each of the top level terms in this file is the root term of an independent controlled vocabulary
remark: mapping an element of the PSI Molecular Interaction XML schema.
remark: The correct use of these vocabularies in the PSI Molecular Interaction XML schema is
remark: formalized in a mapping file available at http://www.psidev.info/files/validator/xml/MI-CVMapping.xml.
remark: The PSI MI schema defines short labels for controlled vocabulary terms
remark: short labels are reported as PSI-MI-short synonyms that are created when a term is more than 20 characteres long.

def: "Peptide sequences or entire proteins can be displayed on phage capsids by fusion to coat proteins to generate a library of fusion phages each displaying a different peptide. Such a library can then be exploited to identify specific phages that display peptides that bind to any given bait molecule for instance an antibody. The selection is performed by a series of cycles of affinity purification known as panning. The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads and others) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries). Libraries have been assembled on several different phages (Fd, Lambda or T7)." [PMID:10975452, PMID:7708014]

Typically enzymes which confer resistance to antibiotics, such as Dihydrofolate reductase or Beta-lactamase, or proteins that give colorimetric or fluorescent signals are used. The Bait protein is generally the protein under study and the methods are readily adaptable to highthroughput mode." [PMID:11495741]

name: two hybrid
namespace: PSI-MI
def: "The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism. The bait protein is fused to the DNA binding molecule, the prey to the transcriptional activator." [PMID:10967325, PMID:12634794, PMID:1946372]
