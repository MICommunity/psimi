TODO

    - Provide a way to customize additional columns.
        - Use generics in order to simplify
        - Develop a Plugin API to ease of development of extension

    - Drag&Drop GUI:
        - give a way to set override for 'interaction id' and 'alias' source database
        - give a way to load a plugin (Class.forname("plugin class"))

    - Confidence score does not come out when comverting BinaryInteraction to String.    

    - BUG: when we have more than one identity for an interactor, only one is exported.

1.0-beta4-SNAPSHOT

    - When the parser breaks, display an exception that specifies, which line, the content of the line and the column
      that broke the format definition.
    - Added filtering facilities: BinaryInteractionFilter
    - Create a Strategy for handling of unparseable lines
       Ignore
       FailFast
       IgnoreAndLogUnparseableLineToFile

1.0-beta3

    - Create a real Excel exporter using POI.
    - API provides way to set the source databases.
    - Read PSIMITAB file with option of skipping header.
    - PSIMITAB header can be enabled/disabled.
    - Columns 1/2 are now populated with Xref having a qualifier 'identity' and if not found, the first one
      ordered alphabetically on primariId.
    - Columns 3/4 are now populated with gene name only.
    - Columns 5/6 with the other aliases available.
    - Column 14 contains the Interaction identifier(s).
    - Possibility of reading PSIMITAB file with iterator, to avoid memory exception when processing large files
    - When generating the database source of the Alias (column 5/6), the database that was used as source for
      identity is used. If more than one is available none is assigned and the keywork 'unknown' is used.
      It is possible to override the database source in the API in order to set an arbitrary database source.
    - Interactor now has a single Organism instead of a List and an Organism contains a list of cross reference
      allowing to defines its identity in multiple source database.   

    - Bug fixes:
               - Clustering of interator pair doesn't work perfectly (eg. A-B and B-A)
               - Output source database/id in column 13
               - Fix PsimitabReader tests
               - Clustering by interactor pair omitted the mergind of interaction Acs (column 14).
