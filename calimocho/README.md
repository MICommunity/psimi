# calimocho

This module implements an API that represents interactions as a Row in a Document. A Row is a list of Fields and each Field is a map of key/value pairs. It also includes an interface of the interaction keys that are used to define the column keys in each MITAB version in the module [calimocho-tab](https://github.com/MICommunity/psimi/tree/master/calimocho-tab).
